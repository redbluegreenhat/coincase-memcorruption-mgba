# coincase-memcorruption-mgba
A port of TheZZAZZGlitch's coincase static analysis tool to mGBA 0.10
TheZZAZZGlitch's original script, available at https://sites.google.com/site/thezzazzglitch/ was written for the VBA emulator. The one here has been ported to mGBA 0.10
To use it, get a mGBA build with Lua support, start up a 2nd generation Pokemon game, and load this script through Tools -> Scripting.
The original video showcasing this script is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6u6rrx51Mg
